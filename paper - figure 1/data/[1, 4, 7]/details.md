The networks contain 100 memories. 
Are initialized with Gaussian initial conditions, N(-0.001, 1e-08). 
The learning rate is 0.005.
The momentum is 0.0.
The digits included in training are [1, 4, 7]; This takes the 1, 4, 7s from ../miniBatchs_images.npy. (20 of each class as before -> M=60 in total ).
